# Conditions
Conditional statements are around the most basic parts of a program. They can split apart the flows of a program, or create detours within it, and allow you extensive control over your program's function.

Conditional statements in lua, or if statements, would look like this:
```lua
if (condition) then
  -- things that happen if the condition is true here
end
```
Anything inside that chunk will only run if the condition required is fulfilled - the value of it is 'true'.
